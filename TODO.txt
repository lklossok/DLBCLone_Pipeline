1. Snakemake workflow for DLBCLone core analysis
   - prepare_metadata
   - assemble_genetic_features
   - make_and_annotate_umap
   - DLBCLone_optimize_params
   - DLBCLone_predict 

2. Build Dockerfile for DLBCLone Pipeline
   
   What is Docker? The whole point is to create a reproducible environment for running code.
      A Dockerfile is a blueprint for creating a Docker image 
      A Docker image is a template for running docker containers
      A container is just a running process
   
   PUSH TO DOCKER HUB FOR PUBLIC USE
   # docker login
   # docker tag dlbclone:latest lklossok\dlbclone:latest
   # docker push lklossok\dlbclone:latest

   BUILD DOCKER IMAGE LOCALLY
   # cd C:\Users\lukeg\Documents\Morin_Lab\DLBCLone_Pipeline\Modules\DLBCLone
   # docker build -t dlbclone:latest .


3. Implement CLI for DLBCLone
   - Allow users to run the Snakemake workflow with custom parameters


TODO LIST: 
   COMPLETE - get docker container operating 
   - add Rscripts for each rule
   - what happens when you need assemble_genetic_features?
   - what happens when loading a DLBCLone_model no longer needing make_and_annotate_umap 
     and DLBCLone_optimize_params?
   - how to best handle multiple samples?
