MissingOutputException in rule DLBCLone_predict in file /mnt/work/DLBCLone_Pipeline/Modules/DLBCLone/DLBCLone.smk, line 37:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/DLBCLone_predictions.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
